## 🎯 Project Overview

**mocnpub** is a high-performance Nostr npub vanity address miner.

**Goal**:
- Find nsec (private key) that produces npub with desired prefix
- Achieve maximum performance using GPGPU (CUDA) 🚀

**Final Results**:
- **5.9B keys/sec** (**84,935x** faster than CPU) 🔥
- 8-character prefix found in ~4 minutes

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Language: Rust 🦀

- Cross-platform (WSL + Windows)
- Rich crypto libraries (`secp256k1` Rust bindings)
- Long-term stability (static linking, no runtime dependencies)
- CUDA integration via `cudarc` crate

### GPGPU: CUDA 🔥

- Optimized for NVIDIA GPUs (RTX 5070 Ti)
- Best performance (NVIDIA-specific optimizations)
- Well-documented (easier to learn)

---

## 🖥️ Development Environment

### Building

```bash
cargo build --release
```

PTX is auto-compiled by `build.rs`.

### WSL + Windows Workflow

- Develop, commit, push in WSL
- `git pull` and run on Windows
- Windows native execution maximizes performance

## 🚀 Optimization Journey (6 weeks)

| Step | Content | Result |
|------|---------|--------|
| Step 0-1 | Environment setup, Mandelbrot | GPU verified |
| Step 2-2.5 | CPU miner | 70K keys/sec |
| Step 3 | GPU port | 1.16M keys/sec (16x) |
| Step 4 | Consecutive keys + Montgomery | 391M keys/sec (5,586x) |
| Step 5-13 | Parameter tuning | 4.15B keys/sec (59,286x) |
| Step 14-35 | PTX optimization | **5.94B keys/sec (84,935x)** |

### Key Optimizations

**Algorithmic**:
- Consecutive secret keys + PointAdd (~300x lighter than ScalarMult)
- Montgomery's Trick (~85x reduction in inversions)
- Endomorphism (2.9x coverage)
- dG table precompute (+12.7%)
- Addition Chain (128→14 multiplications for inversion)
- Z² cumulative product strategy (1600 fewer ModSquare ops)

**GPU**:
- Triple Buffering (100% GPU utilization)
- Constant Memory (dG table, patterns/masks)
- Branchless arithmetic (_ModSub/_ModAdd)
- `__launch_bounds__(128, 5)`

**PTX**:
- Inline PTX assembly (carry/borrow chains)
- Specialized functions: _Add64x3, _Add320, _Sub256
- Pipeline stall reduction
- Loop fusion

## 📚 Development Philosophy

- Learn by doing (CUDA, Rust, secp256k1 all new)
- Take time to understand deeply
- Keep learning files in git (project growth matters) 🌱
